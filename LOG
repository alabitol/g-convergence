Description: This is where we keep log of our weekly progress on the project.
*******************************************************************************

Week 1:

Initially, we were going to implement the web server portion of our notary
ourselves using by using sockets and pthread. After a while, it became
apparent that we would be duplicating a lot of functionality that has
already been implemented before and is available for use via a C
library. After a little bit of searching we found that libmicrohttpd provides
exactly what we are looking for. Thus, we decided to use this library in our
project to provide the functionality of a web server. 

First, we proceeded to learn about how to use this library by stepping
through tutorial available at 

www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/tutorial.html

We established that we were going to have a meeting of the entire group on
Sunday and also meet once or twice during the week in smaller groups to pair
program and discuss specific implementation issues.


Week 2:

We decided that we wanted to use the prototype+extensions development
methodology, so after learning about libmicrohttpd from the tutorial, we wrote
stubs of the most high-level functions that we need to provide the essential
functionality of the Convergence server. Once we determined all the high level
functions that we necessarily needed, we split the implementation of
functions in individual files among ourselves keeping in mind the advantages
of pair programming and code review.

We also found it useful to create a UML diagram to help us visualize the
role of various components in the project and the interactions between them.

Finally, we created a central repository on Github, which we each cloned in
our individual accounts. We decided that each of us is going to have pull and
push privileges to this repository.


Week 3:

After we decided on the structure of the system, we began implementing the
functions that we specified. Many of our implementation choices were
determined by libmicrohttpd library which mandates a particular sequence and
structure of server operations. Thus, in our implementation we drew
inspiration from examples in the tutorial examples we found on the
libmicrohttpd website. 

We spent considerable amount of time plowing through the documentation and
server examples to understand how to properly use various library functions.


Week 4:

It is high time to begin writing tests for the entire system as well as unit
tests for individual functions. For this purpose we created a file called
notary-test.c, in which we will perform all the tests.
